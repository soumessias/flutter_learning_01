# Perguntas do Casal

My first app made with Dart/Flutter! ðŸš€

In it I learned about:
* The difference between StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget
* How to use the Scaffold, appBar and BottomNavigationBar
* How to wrap widgets in an easy way (for example, placing a button inside a container)
* How to use Column/Row
* How to use map to traverse a list and automatically generate multiple buttons
* How to use ElevatedButton
